    "Working at the level of the province with a couple thousand inscriptions at a time, scholars have started constructing regional diachronic overviews of epigraphic production. Comparative studies between North Africa, Gaul or Greece revealed that epigraphic production in these provinces follows the same diachronic pattern. Inscription numbers peak at the end of the second century AD, during the reign of Septimius Severus (AD 193 - AD 211), and decline abruptly in the beginning of the third century AD (MacMullen 1982; Meyer 1991; Woolf 1996). Researchers started exploring different drivers for such convergence, interrogating the role of funerary habits to the popularity of public status display to the democratisation of citizenship. For instance, Elizabeth Meyer used the example of epitaphs to explain the drop in the number of inscriptions after the Constitutio Antoniniana in AD 212 granted Roman citizenship to all inhabitants of the Roman Empire. According to Meyer, being a Roman citizen lost some of its prestige and so did funerary inscriptions as public markers of societal status (Meyer 1990, 78-81). Such explanations failed to address the phenomenon of epigraphic production in all its breadth and complexity, focusing only on funerary inscriptions from selected regions. Since the time of MacMullen many scholars have attempted to study epigraphic production at the scale of the Empire (e.g., Hedrick 1999; Trout 2009; Beltran Lloris 2014; Bolle, Machado, and Witschel 2017; Nawotka 2021; Blanco Perez 2021). These efforts have been hindered first by the constraints on interoperability and integration of digital datasets, second, by the volume and diversity of epigraphic data, and finally, by the inability to precisely quantify the number of inscriptions at any point in time (Beltran Lloris 2014, 139)."

     "abstract": "In times of violence, people tend to hide their valuables, which are later recovered unless the owners had been killed or driven away. Thus, the temporal distribution of unrecovered coin hoards is an excellent proxy for the intensity of internal warfare. We use this relationship to resolve a long-standing controversy in Roman history. Depending on who was counted in the early Imperial censuses (adult males or the entire citizenry including women and minors), the Roman citizen population of Italy either declined, or more than doubled, during the first century BCE. This period was characterized by a series of civil wars, and historical evidence indicates that high levels of sociopolitical instability are associated with demographic contractions. We fitted a simple model quantifying the effect of instability (proxied by hoard frequency) on population dynamics to the data before 100 BCE. The model predicts declining population after 100 BCE. This suggests that the vigorous growth scenario is highly implausible.",
