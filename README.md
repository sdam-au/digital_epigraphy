## Abstract
As short texts written on a durable medium, inscriptions represent invaluable insight into past societies, their organisation, cultural norms and practices. Several hundred thousand inscriptions in Greek and Latin language survived until today, providing us with a line of evidence concerning populations of large cities and rural communities of the entire Mediterranean Basin in the period between the eighth century BC and eighth century AD. Although data on inscriptions have been mostly digitized in online databases surrounded with ample digital tools, large-scale and comparative studies of inscriptions are still rare. Numerous technical and conceptual issues, such as inconsistent resolution of spatial and temporal attributes or variable provenance, hinder the aggregation and analysis of thousands of inscriptions. This article presents open-source tools and reproducible approaches we developed and applied to the aggregated digital epigraphic dataset before attempting an macro-scale overview of this incomplete, uncertain and complex historical source. We contrast and combine two well-established, yet very distinct, digital sources for Latin epigraphy: Epigraphic Database Heidelberg (EDH), containing over 81,000 records and Epigraphische Datenbank Clauss-Slaby (EDCS) with over 500,000 records. We compare long-term trends of epigraphic production generated from each of the two sources and discuss the caveats of large-scale studies based on incomplete and biased historical sources.
