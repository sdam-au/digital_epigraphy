# Data
1. [Epigraphic Database Heidelber (EDH)](https://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/home) dataset is accessed and transformed by the series of Python and R scripts in [EDH ETL repository](https://github.com/sdam-au/EDH_ETL) and in [EDH exploration repository](https://github.com/sdam-au/EDH_exploration), created by SDAM Project. The latest version of the dataset (as JSON file) can be accessed via Sciencedata.dk or at this link: [EDH_public folder](https://sciencedata.dk/shared/b6b6afdb969d378b70929e86e58ad975)

* Result of ETL process JSON file: `EDH_text_cleaned_2021-01-21.json`

2. [Epigraphic Database Clauss-Slaby (EDCS)](http://www.manfredclauss.de/) dataset is accessed and transformed by the series of Python and R scripts in [EDCS ETL repository](https://github.com/sdam-au/EDCS_ETL), created by SDAM project.

## Data Access

**Access with R (using custom `sdam` package)**

```r
resp = request("EDH_text_cleaned_2021-01-21.json", path="/sharingin/648597@au.dk/SDAM_root/SDAM_data/EDH/public", method="GET")
```

**Access with Python (using custom [SDDK package](https://pypi.org/project/sddk/))**

```python
!pip install sddk
import sddk
auth = sddk.configure("SDAM_root", "648597@au.dk") #Â where "648597@au.dk is owner of the shared folder
EDH_utf8 = sddk.read_file("public/b6b6afdb969d378b70929e86e58ad975/EDH_text_cleaned_2021-01-21.json", "df", auth)
